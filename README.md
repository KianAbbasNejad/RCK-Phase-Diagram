# RCK-Phase-Diagram
This simple code plots the stationary loci, saddle path and vector field in (capital, consumption) space for a simple Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model. The code uses user-input parameter values (or the user can choose default parameters). 

The vector field is made more aesthetically pleasing by resizing the vectors by their norm. If the user wants, this feature can be easily removed from the code.

Finally, note that the saddle path is plotted by solving the ODE backward from the (known) steady state. Therefore it is not precise and is mostly aimed for graphical analysis. 

**Functions appear at the end of the code**
