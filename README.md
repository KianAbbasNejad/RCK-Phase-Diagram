# RCK Phase Portrait
This script plots the stationary loci, saddle path and vector field in (capital, consumption) space for a simple Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model. It uses user-input parameter values (or the user can choose default parameters). 

The vector field is made more aesthetically pleasing by resizing the vectors by their norm. If the user wants, this feature can be easily removed from the script.

Finally, note that the saddle path (stable manifold) is plotted by creating a polygon around the steady state and solving it backward. 

**Functions appear at the end of the code**
